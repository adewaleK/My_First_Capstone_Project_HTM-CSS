# My_First_Capstone_Project_HTM-CSS

## Project Description

This is a capstone project which requires me to develop an HTML-CSS website which is similar in features to the one designed by Cindy Shin in Behance ([https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015)). It specifically involves personalizing the design to create a similar website.
## How it was Implemented

The design in the source is that of a conference center but I was able to transform it into a web development course website. The project was built mainly with HTML and CSS and involves three pages. The site was made responsive across different screen sizes by implementing it for screen sizes above and below 768px.
